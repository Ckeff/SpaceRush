	Additions/Fixes:
	- Game Environment created
	- Player movement implemented
	- Screen wrapping implemented
	
	Bugs:
	- Player can't move diagonally
	- If Player hasn't fully decelerate when they switch from horiz. movement to vert. movement (and vice-versa), the player will resume with the previous acceleration they had upon switching back
	- Not a bug, but the player will eventually need to be it's own class
